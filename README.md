# 🤖 AI-Powered Automated Ticket Classification System  

**⚡ End-to-End Multi-Agent Workflow for Real-Time Support Triage**

The manual process of triaging incoming customer support emails is slow, inconsistent, and drains valuable engineering time.  
This project implements an intelligent, autonomous **multi-agent system** that automatically ingests customer emails, analyzes sentiment, classifies intent, and creates prioritized, labeled tickets in **Trello** within seconds.  

This system demonstrates how to connect **AI inference (FastAPI)** with **workflow automation (n8n)** to achieve **real-time, business-critical results**.

## ✨ Key Features & Capabilities

| Icon | Feature | Description |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 🧠 | **Multi-Agent Architecture** | A collaborative team of four specialized agents powered by the **Gemini model** handle all aspects of analysis and action. |
| ⚡ | **Real-Time Automation** | Uses **n8n** to trigger the workflow immediately upon email arrival, delivering sub-second ticket creation via API chaining. |
| 📊 | **Intelligent Prioritization** | Classifies tickets by Category and tags them by Sentiment (Positive, Negative). |
| 🔗 | **Seamless Integration** | **FastAPI** provides a robust, scalable inference layer that plugs directly into **n8n** and the **Trello API**. |
| 🧪 | **Streamlit Testing UI** | A simple frontend allows developers to test the agents' logic manually against any sample text. |
| 💡 | **Constrained LLM Output** | Agents are highly constrained to output structured, parsable data for reliable downstream automation. |

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Workflow

The system’s core value lies in the **automated loop** that transforms unstructured email text into structured Trello data.

### 🌐 End-to-End Automated Flow

A high-level view of how a customer email is transformed into a ready-to-work Trello card:

    B -->|HTTP POST Request| ;
    C --> D(Multi-Agent System Executes);
    D -->|Structured JSON Output| B;
    B --> E(n8n: Trello Node);
    E --> F[Trello Card Created: Priority & Sentiment Labeled];

🧩 Agent Breakdown (Core Logic in agents.py)
Each agent runs a concise, constrained prompt against the input text to ensure reliable, parsable output for the n8n workflow.

Agent Name	Function	Prompt Constraint & Output
email_agent	Rewriter	Rewrites the message as a short, professional email (2–3 lines max).
ticket_agent	Classifier	Classifies with: `Category: ...
sentiment_agent	Tagging	Replies with only one word: Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
suggestion_agent	Recommender	Gives one short actionable suggestion (max 1 line) for resolution.

⚙️ Tech Stack

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.10+

Gemini API Key

Trello API Key and Board ID (for n8n integration)

1. Installation & Setup
bash
Copy code
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Faisal-58/n8n-ai-ticket-classifier.git
cd n8n-ai-ticket-classifier

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Configuration
Create a file named .env in the project root and populate it with your credentials:

ini
Copy code
# Core LLM Key
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

# Trello Credentials (for n8n integration)
TRELLO_API_KEY="YOUR_TRELLO_API_KEY"
TRELLO_TOKEN="YOUR_TRELLO_TOKEN"
TRELLO_BOARD_ID="YOUR_TRELLO_BOARD_ID"
3. Running the Project
🧠 Run the FastAPI Backend (Agent Server)
This starts the inference API hosting all agents.

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
# Server running at: http://127.0.0.1:8000
🧪 Run the Streamlit UI (Manual Testing)
Open a new terminal for the Streamlit application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
# UI accessible at: http://localhost:8501


💡 Future Enhancements
📨 Add auto-reply generation using Gemini API

🔔 Integrate Slack notifications for new tickets

🧾 Log tickets in a PostgreSQL database

🌍 Extend to multi-channel input sources (chatbots, forms, WhatsApp)
